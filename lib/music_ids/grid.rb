  # The GRid class represents a Global Release Identifier, and
  # provides simple methods to parse and re-present them.
  #
  # == What is a GRid?
  # GRid's are unique identifiers for Releases of recorded music, as distinct
  # from different Products (See the GRid Handbook for more details). They're
  # often used as key identifiers in the delivery and reporting of digital
  # music products.
  #
  # You can get more details from
  # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Release_Identifier and
  # http://www.ifpi.org/grid.php
  #
  # == Well-formedness and validity
  # GRid's are supposed to be able to be looked up in a global database, so we
  # need to draw a distinction between *valid* GRid's, which are GRid's we have
  # looked up and verified in that database, and well-formed GRid's, which are
  # just strings that match the requirements above.
  #
  # Checking or enforcing validity is beyond the scope of this class.
  # Well-formedness, on the other hand, is easy to check and enforce.
  #
  # While you don't want to be emitting badly-formed GRid's, if you handle
  # GRid's from elsewhere you may well run across bad metadata that you need to
  # preserve, but probably want to be aware of the fact that it's bad.
  #
  # To help with that there are two parsing modes, strict (the default), and
  # relaxed.
  #
  # In strict parsing mode, <tt>GRid.parse</tt> will raise an error if passed a
  # badly-formed GRid string. In relaxed mode, it will return an <tt>GRid</tt>
  # instance that will return <tt>false</tt> from <tt>#ok?</tt> and will return
  # nil from all the component methods like <tt>#issuer</tt>
