  # The ISRC class represents an International Standard Recording Code, and
  # provides simple methods to parse and re-present them.
  #
  # == What is an ISRC?
  # An ISRC is a globally unique ID for an audio / video recording of a piece
  # of music. (That is, two different recordings of the same song should have
  # different ISRCs)
  #
  # ISRCs consist of four blocks of information: a two-letter country code,
  # three-character registrant code, two-digit year (see #year), and five-digit
  # designation code. There are two main string representations: the canonical
  # 12-character version, and a 15-character version that inserts hyphens (-)
  # between the blocks.
  #
  # The first two blocks identify, essentially, a record company / distributor
  # and their country of origin, the last two blocks provide a unique recording
  # number for that company in a particular year.
  #
  # You can get more details from
  # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Recording_Code and
  # http://www.usisrc.org/
  #
  # == Well-formedness and validity
  # ISRC's are supposed to be able to be looked
  # up in a global database, so we need to draw a distinction between *valid*
  # ISRC's, which are ISRC's we have looked up in that database and verified,
  # and well-formed ISRC's, which is to say strings matching the requirements
  # above.
  #
  # Checking or enforcing validity is beyond the scope of this class.
  # Well-formedness, on the other hand, is easy to check and enforce.
  #
  # While you don't want to be emitting badly-formed ISRCs, if you handle
  # ISRC's from elsewhere you may well run across bad metadata that you need to
  # preserve, but probably want to be aware of the fact that it's bad.
  #
  # To help with that there are two parsing modes, strict (the default), and
  # relaxed.
  #
  # In strict parsing mode, <tt>ISRC.parse</tt> will raise an error if passed a
  # badly-formed ISRC string. In relaxed mode, it will return an <tt>ISRC</tt>
  # instance that will return <tt>false</tt> from <tt>#ok?</tt> and will return
  # nil from all the component methods like <tt>#registrant</tt>
